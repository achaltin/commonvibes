about: "Ashlyn Kelley is a Chicago based screenwriter/director who also works a lot producing films as well as doing casting and SFX makeup. On top of this she is a talent agent at a Chicago non-union talent agency. This project is her baby, a combination of her female centric film making style and her silly sense of humor. She has never been this happy with a cast or crew, and cannot wait to keep working with them. @akfeatures"
