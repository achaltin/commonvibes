<blockquote><p>'Two in four women and one in 6 men will be sexually assaulted at some point in their lives, many of them multiple times. Research confirms we can cut our pain in half by sharing with others who understand. Sharing also provides new strategies and tips for coping with PTSD and other conditions that result from assaults. We must learn how to not only cope, but get past it and flourish in our society. Only with one another's help can we do this.'</p><p class="quote-source"> --A sex therapist who happens to be treating someone on this project</p></blockquote>

DNA evidence can be recovered within 72 hours of the assault, but there may be other evidence that lasts longer. <a href="https://www.rainn.org/articles/rape-kit" target="_blank">This is the process of undergoing a rape kit.</a>
