<p class="question">What is your ideal first date?</p> 

<p class="answer">What can I say, I'm boring and like to go to a restaurant or cafe or someplace where we can talk and get to know each other.</p>

<p class="question">Would you rather have your laugh sound like a loud trumpet or be completely silent every time? </p>

<p class="answer">Oh the loud trumpet for sure. Then anytime I'm at a movie or a show or something and I laugh, there will be that second wave of laughter where everyone reacts to the weird laugh.</p>

<p class="question">What is your most embarrassing moment? </p>

<p class="answer">When I was in middle school, someone poured a bottle of water on a slide right at the bottom and I forgot about it and slid down causing it to look like I peed my pants... right in front of my crush.</p>
