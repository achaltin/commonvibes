<p class="question">Favorite exotic animal</p>

<p class="answer">Cheetah. Has been since I first saw one.</p>

<p class="question">Would you rather have tiny fingers instead of a tongue or tongues instead of fingers? </p>

<p class="answer">Tongues. Always the tongue.</p>

<p class="question">Would you rather have your laugh sound like a loud trumpet or be completely silent every time? </p>

<p class="answer">I have nothing against a snort out loud joke, but I grew up in London so I prefer my wit bone dry and dead on arrival.</p>
