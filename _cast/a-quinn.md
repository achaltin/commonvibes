<p class="question">Weirdest sexual dream?</p>

<p class="answer">Okay please no one tell Jonny this but I once dreamt I was Johnny Depp and was having sex with a girl. </p>



<p class="question">Exotic animal?</p>

<p class="answer">Do snow leopards count? They are the COOLEST have you seen how fluffy their tails are? </p> 



<p class="question">Fingers or tongues? </p>

<p class="answer">Definitely fingers for a tongue. Tongues for fingers would be squishy and weird. Although, I could probably hold so much with tongue-fingers, since tongues are so strong...BUT would I taste everything I touch and hold and carry?? Ooo. Okay I’m going with tiny fingers.  </p>
