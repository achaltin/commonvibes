<p class="question">What is your most embarrassing moment?  </p>

<p class="answer">I shit my pants at bottomless brunch in New York City with my family. I threw the boxers out in the bathroom trash and flew commando in jeans for the day.</p>

<p class="question">If you could have dinner with any famous person dead or alive who would it be? </p>

<p class="answer">Probably Donald Glover, but I'm feeling pretty homesick, so my family also. Or just a really relaxed dinner with a few of my friends. Or AOC.</p>

<p class="question">Favorite sex position? </p>

<p class="answer">Ooh, I like most sex positions, but I like getting top. Idk many names, but I'm probably down!</p>
